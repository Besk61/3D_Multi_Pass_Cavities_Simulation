3D simulation of Heriott-type multi-pass cavities
With the development of technology, laser technology has started to take a place in our daily lives. Barcode readers of supermarkets, later laser disc readers and compact disc players were the first laser-equipped devices. In addition to these, it is frequently used in industrial, military and medical fields. Although laser production is useful, installing advanced laser systems and creating the laser is a laborious and costly process. In order to get rid of such situations, the “Multi-Pass Cavities Model” has been designed.

The Multipass Cavity Model is used to increase the laser pulse energy by extending the laser gap path length and reducing the repetition rate, and to make standard repetition rate lasers more compact. In this way, both the system cost is reduced and the system is simplified.

In this study, the necessary criteria for designing the "Multi-Pass Cavity Model" were investigated and 2 and 3 dimensional simulations were carried out. With the parameters to be entered by the user, the points where the incoming beam bounces and the points where it exits the mirror can be observed in detail. In this way, before designing the "Multi-Pass Gap Model" in practice, the desired model can be tested and a model can be created in the light of the findings.
